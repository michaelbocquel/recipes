	<h1>Greek Baklava</h1>

	<p>Baklava is a delicious Greek dessert made up of layers of crispy phyllo dough, honey and nuts that's sooo easy to
		make. A Greek friend showed me how to make this fabulous recipe.</p>

	<p class="subtitle">Ingredients</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Phyllo Dough</li>
		<li>Nuts</li>
		<li>Butter</li>
		<li>Cinnamon</li>
		<li>Water, Sugar, Vanilla and Honey</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="subtitle">Directions</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Stack eight sheets of phyllo dough, brushing with butter between each layer, to create a sturdy base.
			Sprinkle it with a mixture of chopped nuts and cinnamon. Top with two sheets of phyllo dough and follow with
			the nut mixture. Repeat this process a few more times, until the nut mixture is gone. Top with about eight
			more layers of phyllo, buttering each layer.</li>
		<li>Cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes. Be sure to cut all the way to the bottom of the pan. Bake
			until golden and crisp.</li>
